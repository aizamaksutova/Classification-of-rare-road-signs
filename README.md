# Classification_of_rare_road_signs
Project on building a classifier for rare traffic signs

## Overview
This repository addresses the classification of rare road signs, a challenge due to the scarcity of real-world examples. The project introduces synthetic sampling to create data for these uncommon signs, enhancing classification methods. Classifying rare road signs is difficult because of limited real-world examples. Traditional classification struggles with new and uncommon sign types.

## Solution. What do we do to tackle this problem? 
Synthetic Sample Generation: Generating synthetic examples of rare signs to augment the dataset.
Specialized Classifier: Implementing a nearest neighbor method classifier optimized for these synthetic samples.

## Goals
Demonstrate synthetic sample generation for rare road sign classification.
Test a tailored classifier and improve key metrics.
